## Philosophers' Dinner in JAVA

The Philosophers' Dinner was proposed by Dijkstra in 1965 as a synchronization problem. Since then, all algorithms proposed as synchronization solutions have either been related to or tested against the Philosophers' Dinner problem.

#### Definition of the Philosophers' Dinner Problem
Five philosophers are seated at a round table for dinner. Each philosopher has a plate of spaghetti in front of them. Each plate has a fork for picking up the spaghetti. The spaghetti is very slippery, and for a philosopher to eat, they will need to use two forks.
